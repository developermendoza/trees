    <h1>Trees</h1>
    <p>
      In Computer science, a tree is a hieraichical data structure that consist
      of nodes connected by edges. Each node in a tree has a parent node (except
      for the root) and zero or more child nodes.
      <b>The topmost node in a tree is called the root</b>, and
      <b>nodes with no children are called leaves.</b> The depth of a node is
      the length of the path from the root to that node, and the height of a
      tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trees are used to model hierarchical relationships and are prevelant in
      many algorithms and data structures. There are various types of trees,
      each with its own characteristics, such as binary trees, binary search
      trees, and balanced trees.
